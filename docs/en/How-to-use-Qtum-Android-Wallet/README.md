# Qtum Mobile Wallet (Android)

We have finally! updated our legacy Qtum Mobile wallet for Android, it was an overdue update and we're glad to have a new release which also looks great!.



# How to use the All-New Qtum Android Wallet

## 1. Create New Wallet
To use Qtum Wallet for the first time or create new Qtum Wallet, you could use the Create New button on the login page of the APP. In order to setup your wallet, you will need to enter your PIN twice, which will be used for logging in and making transactions later. Then, the system will randomly generate 12 seed words that are used to recover the wallet. These seed words should be kept safely and securely to avoid from being stolen. After backing up your seed words, you'll need to input them in the correct order to verify your account. After this, your wallet will be successfully created.

##2. Recover Wallet / Import Wallet
When you forget the transaction password of your Qtum Wallet, you can setup new transaction password by recovering your wallet. By using the Import Wallet function on the APP's login page, you can also import an existing wallet account when you switch your phone or change wallet application. There are two ways to import a wallet: 1. import seed words; 2. import private key. If you're importing seed words from a mobile or web wallet, the original transaction password will be needed as well. After importing your wallet successfully, enter your password twice and you'll complete the process.

##3. Send Cryptocurrency
Sending tokens in Qtum Wallet is very easy. You can find the send button on the bottom-left corner on the home page. There are three ways to input receiver's address: 1. copy and paste or input the address by hand (which is risky); 2. scan receiver's QR code, their address will be identified automatically by the wallet; 3. choose from the address book, which can be added using the home page's setup function. After entering amount and remarks, you need to tap the Next to confirm the transaction information. You can tap the Next after the transaction information is verified, and the transaction can be initiated by entering the password.
