# Wallet Backup Reminder



Qtum 0.18.2 has a very useful wallet backup reminder, here's a couple of screenshots showing how it looks and works:

We get this reminder on when the wallet launches for the first time, we can decide to backup later or backup now (recommended).

Another new, cool feature about the 0.18.2 Qtum release is the Staking Button, it enables staking on your Qtum wallet by simply pressing the above button, if the wallet is encrypted, you'll be asked to unlock the wallet.

Here we unlock the wallet and decide if we want to fully unlock or unlock for staking only.
