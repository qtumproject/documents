# Staking Qtum on FreeBSD

FreeBSD is a very powerful operating system, it has a great history of reliability, security and stability. Here we show how it can be used to stake Qtum in a secure way.

## Sandboxing Qtum in a FreeBSD jail

FreeBSD jails are a very powerful feature, in summary, your jail instance is more protected as it's like having a separate OS just for Qtum with reduced privileges. 

Here's a good read on Jails:  https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html

### FreeBSD version used for this tutorial is 12.2, download it from the official FreeBSD mirrors:

https://www.freebsd.org/where/

### Installing FreeBSD

**Important**: Make sure to install and enable NTP, it's necesary to stay synchronized to network clocks.

Install FreeBSD as normal, however, the following hardening settings are recommended during install:

![hardening.png](hardening.png)

### Create user

Create a user with permissions "operator wheel"

![adduser.png](adduser.png)

Please remember to do all these commands as root

## Host:

### /etc/sysctl.conf

### Allow sockets and upgrades in jail

`security.jail.allow_raw_sockets=1`

`security.jail.chflags_allowed=1`

![sysctl.png](sysctl.png)

### /etc/rc.conf

`firewall_enable="YES"`

`firewall_quiet="YES"`

`firewall_type="workstation"`

`firewall_myservices="22 3888"`

`firewall_allowservices="any"`

`firewall_logdeny="YES"`

`jail_enable="YES"`

![rcconf.png](rcconf.png)

Notice that we've added some settings for firewall, these will enable IPFW and basic settings to secure our Jail, allowing only ports 22(ssh) and 3888(Qtum) to be accessed.

### Resource limits for Jails

### /boot/loader.conf

`kern.racct.enable=1`

` jail_enable="YES"`

![bootloader.png](bootloader.png)

### Creating our Jail for staking

`zfs create -o mountpoint=/jail  zroot/jail`

**(Change zroot for whatever name you chose for your zfs pool)**  

`zfs create -o mountpoint=/jail/qtum  zroot/jail/qtum`

![createqtumjail.png](createqtumjail.png)

### Now we've created our jail for staking Qtum, let's fetch and install FreeBSD on it!

`cd /jail/qtum/ && fetch -o  - http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/12.2-RELEASE/base.txz | tar --unlink -xpJf - -C /jail/qtum `

![fetch.png](fetch.png)

#### We've now installed FreeBSD into /jail/qtum

Typing ls /jail/qtum/ should show the filesystem of our Qtum FreeBSD Jail

Now, let's create the jail configuration file:

### /etc/jail.conf

`qtum {`

`  host.hostname = qtum.local;`

`  ip4.addr = 192.168.0.99;`

`  interface = em0;`

`  path = /jail/qtum;`

`  exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";`

`  exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";`

`  exec.clean;`

`  mount.devfs;`

`  allow.raw_sockets;`

`  allow.sysvipc;`

`}`

![jailconfig.png](jailconfig.png)

Ok now it's time to launch our jail!

` service jail start qtum `

#### We've just started our Qtum jail, We can now get into our Qtum jail to finish configuration, install Qtum and launch the wallet.

` jexec qtum /bin/csh`

` cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/YOURTIMEZONE/ /etc/localtime  `
This is very important, if the time info is incorrect, we'll produce orphan blocks or will be unable to sync

Create our basic /etc/rc.conf for our Qtum Jail

## Qtum Jail:

### /etc/rc.conf

`syslogd_flags="-s -s"`

`sshd_enable=YES`

`clear_tmp_enable=YES`

`clear_tmp_X=YES`

`extra_netfs_types=NFS`

`dumpdev=NO`

`update_motd=NO`

`keyrate=fast`
`sendmail_enable=NONE`

`sendmail_submit_enable=NO`

`sendmail_outbound_enable=NO`

`sendmail_msp_queue_enable=NO`

## Add dns nameservers to /etc/resolv.conf

`echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf`

`echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" >> /etc/resolv.conf`

## Installing Qtum

Now that we've got our jail up and running, we need to install Qtum.
There's 2 options on doing this, we can use the pkg repository or the powerful FreeBSD ports which are usually updated faster:

#### pkg repository

`pkg update -f`
`pkg install -y qtum`

![pkginstallqtum.png](pkginstallqtum.png)

#### FreeBSD ports

`portsnap fetch extract`
`cd /usr/ports/net-p2p/qtum && make install clean`

![portsnapfetchextract.png](portsnapfetchextract.png)The above will ask for a lot of configuration options, it might be better to use make config-recursive to set all options before compiling.
If you want to use default settings just type `cd /usr/ports/net-p2p/qtum && make install clean BATCH="YES"`

### Running Qtum

Launching Qtum is just like in any other *NIX operating system, however there's a minor difference here due to how FreeBSD jails work. First, we need to create a qtum.conf file with the following contents:

![qtumconf.png](qtumconf.png)

This config is necessary, otherwise calling the daemon will return errors.

Then we can launch with`qtumd -daemon`

## Security tips

- Set up firewall on host (you cannot setup a firewall inside a jail) and enable only the ports you need (22 and 3888) This is done in the host rc.conf at the top of this tutorial

- Disable history, this will completely disable console history and it's a way to help secure your staking box, type the following on your FreeBSD console: ` unset history; unset savehist `

- Secure SSH: 
  
  1. Disable password authentication![ssh2.png](ssh2.png)![ssh4.png](ssh4.png)
     ![ssh5.png](ssh5.png)
2. If using the FreeBSD box on your home network, force it to listen on local network only.
