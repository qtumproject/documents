# Qnekt

[Qnekt](https://github.com/earlgreytech/metamask-extension) is a fork of Metamask

* Since Qtum is a fork of Bitcoin and uses UTXOs, transaction signing is completely different from Ethereum.
* Because of that, it is not possible to just add [Janus](/part2/janus.md) as a remote endpoint in Metamask and have everything just work.
* For a more technical understanding, see [Why the need to fork Metamask?](/part3/why-qnekt.md)
